 # Overview

## Description
Creating a text editor that allows multiple users to edit the same document at the same time.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Purpose 
This text editor can be used by students when moving back to in person classes. When we want to share code with each other without having to 
be super close to see the screen of others.

# Development Environment

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Tools Used

The text editor I used is Visual Studio Code, as well as GitHub. I downloaded Git and connected the repo  
to my VS Code. This way I can write content while ensuring it works and is visually easier to work with. 

The node.js library that I used is socket.io. This is made to make networking easier, and the tutorial
for this is very well done.

### Starting with Networking 

I went through a tutorial on React.js [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-real-time-web-with-socket-io/welcome?u=2153100)  
which is through LinkedIn Learning. This tutorial runs through what is networking, and creating a chat board between users. When I worked on this,  
it reminded me of working with python dictionaries. All of the connections or communication between the user and the client is 
based on key's and then data values.  

## To Run Project  
Type *npm start* to run project.  
Type *rs* to restart project. (Good after saving and editing anything)

## Programming Language
This was all done in node.js. The socket.io library is listed above.
